= Spring-Boot Camel Quickstart using REST / SQL QuickStart

This example demonstrates how to use SQL via JDBC along with Camel's REST DSL to expose a RESTful API.

This example relies on the https://maven.fabric8.io[Fabric8 Maven plugin] for its build configuration
and uses the https://github.com/fabric8io/base-images#java-base-images[fabric8 Java base image].

The application utilizes the Spring http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/ImportResource.html[`@ImportResource`] annotation to load a Camel Context definition via a _src/main/resources/spring/camel-context.xml_ file on the classpath.

IMPORTANT: This quickstart can run in 2 modes: standalone on your machine and on Kubernetes / OpenShift Cluster

== Deployment options

You can run this quickstart in the following modes:

* Kubernetes / Single-node OpenShift cluster
* Standalone on your machine

The most effective way to run this quickstart is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

For more details about running this quickstart on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

== Running the Quickstart on a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster

IMPORTANT: You need to run this example on Container Development Kit 3.3 or OpenShift 3.7.
Both of these products have suitable Fuse images pre-installed.
If you run it in an environment where those images are not preinstalled follow the steps described in <<single-node-without-preinstalled-images>>.

A single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your quickstart there.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the quickstart:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. It is assumed that a MySQL service is already running on the platform. You can deploy it using the provided deployment by executing in single-node OpenShift cluster:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/db-templates/mysql-ephemeral-template.json
$ oc new-app --template=mysql-ephemeral
----
+
More information can be found in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/using_images/db_images/mysql.html[using the MySQL database image]. You may need to pass `MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=true` as environment variable to the deployment.

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted quickstart application (for example, `my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rest-sql`) :
+
or
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/spring-boot-camel-rest-sql
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests oc:deploy -Dmysql-service-username=<username> -Dmysql-service-password=<password> -Popenshift
----
+
The `username` and `password` system properties correspond to the credentials used when deploying the MySQL database service.

. In your browser, navigate to the `MY_PROJECT_NAME` project in the OpenShift console.
Wait until you can see that the pod for the `spring-boot-camel-rest-sql` has started up.

. On the project's `Overview` page, navigate to the details page deployment of the `spring-boot-camel-rest-sql` application: `https://OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR:8443/console/project/MY_PROJECT_NAME/browse/pods/spring-boot-camel-rest-sql-NUMBER_OF_DEPLOYMENT?tab=details`.

. Switch to tab `Logs` and then see the messages sent by Camel.

=== Running the Quickstart on a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster without preinstalled images

A single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node Kubernetes/OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your quickstart there.


. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u developer -p developer
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the quickstart:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Configure Red Hat Container Registry authentication (if it is not configured).
Follow https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_fuse/7.9/html-single/fuse_on_openshift_guide/index#configure-container-registry[documentation].

. Import base images in your newly created project (MY_PROJECT_NAME):
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc import-image fuse-java-openshift:2.0 --from=registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-fuse-7/fuse-java-openshift:2.0 --confirm
----

. It is assumed that a MySQL service is already running on the platform. You can deploy it using the provided deployment by executing in single-node OpenShift cluster:
+
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/origin/master/examples/db-templates/mysql-ephemeral-template.json
$ oc new-app --template=mysql-ephemeral
----
+
More information can be found in https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.3/using_images/db_images/mysql.html[using the MySQL database image]. You may need to pass `MYSQL_RANDOM_ROOT_PASSWORD=true` as environment variable to the deployment.

. Switch to tab `Logs` and then see the messages sent by Camel.

== Accessing the REST service

When the example is running, a REST service is available to list the books that can be ordered, and as well the order statuses.

If you run the example on a single-node OpenShift cluster, then the REST service is exposed at 'http://spring-boot-camel-rest-sql-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-sql/`.

Notice: As it depends on your OpenShift setup, the hostname (route) might vary. Verify with `oc get routes` which hostname is valid for you. Add the `-Djkube.deploy.createExternalUrls=true` option to your Maven commands if you want it to deploy a Route configuration for the service.

The actual endpoint is using the _context-path_ `camel-rest-sql/books` and the REST service provides two services:

- `books`: to list all the available books that can be ordered,
- `books/order/{id}`: to output order status for the given order `id`.

The example automatically creates new orders with a running order `id` starting from 1.

You can then access these services from your Web browser, e.g.:

- <http://spring-boot-camel-rest-sql-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-sql/books>
- <http://spring-boot-camel-rest-sql-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-sql/books/order/1>

== Swagger API

The example provides API documentation of the service using Swagger using the _context-path_ `camel-rest-sql/api-doc`. You can access the API documentation from your Web browser at <http://spring-boot-camel-rest-sql-MY_PROJECT_NAME.OPENSHIFT_IP_ADDR.nip.io/camel-rest-sql/api-doc>.

== Running the quickstart standalone on your machine

To run this quickstart as a standalone project on your local machine:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.
. Build the project:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean package
----
. Run the service:

+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn spring-boot:run
----
+
Alternatively, you can run the application locally using the executable JAR produced:
+
----
$ java -jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev target/spring-boot-camel-rest-sql-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----
+
This uses an embedded in-memory HSQLDB database. You can use the default Spring Boot profile in case you have a MySQL server available for you to test.

. You can then access the REST API directly from your Web browser, e.g.:

- <http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-sql/books>
- <http://localhost:8080/camel-rest-sql/books/order/1>
